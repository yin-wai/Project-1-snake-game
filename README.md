# Project-1-snake-game
Classic Snake Game - This is my first project as a General Assembly Student in class of SEI-59

## Pseudo-Code
Use Canvas to define a box for the game to exist in
main screen section where you can either start game or check  high scores
start game function  ———> immediately takes you and start the game 
create the snake within the game 

use a switch case for the movement of the snake
key === 39
key === 38
key === 37
key === 40
make sure that the direction of the snake cannot clash i.e. the left key cannot be clicked if the direction of the snake is right

randomise the baits and generates on the game (maybe insert images of fruits into the game instead of having just squares?) (depend on the time/ capability)
make sure the bait generate is not on top of the snake 

snake tail ++ if head touches a bait plus 100 points for the user?


game ends if 	
	- head of the snake touches  the body of the snake
	- head of the snake touches the border of the game (maybe scrap this if I want the game to proceed for longer

changing to a different screen
records the score 
stores score?
lets the user restart the game and get put back to the main screen
